**What if we had never existed?** The world would not notice. Time would pass, **indifferent**.
And yet,  **here we are**. Breathing. Occupying some space. Thinking. Feeling. **Existing.** Moving through the small routines that fill our days. **Some things fade. Some remain.**
>
We hold on quietly. We try to stay intact, to keep a thread of meaning.
Some parts of us appear only when what we cling to falls away. When loss leaves a space empty, still, something new, or simply different, can emerge.
**Existence is** not in what we preserve. It is **in what is quietly released**, leaving only the traces that cannot be held.
>
At some point, we must accept that **everything**, including ourselves, **must be let go**. What we release creates the space for something else to take form, quietly, without asking for permission—just as space was once given for our own existence.
>
It is not about **being “released”**—discarded, forgotten, or even remembered and missed. None of it matters. What matters is **letting the emptiness we leave behind be filled with seeds that bear fruit**, not weeds. Kindness is not a choice. It is simply what we owe one another—nothing to boast of, nothing to be proud of. It should give nothing in return. **Existence was given**.
